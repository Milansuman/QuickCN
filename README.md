# QuickCN

QuickCN is a shadcn/ui-inspired component library for Qt/QML applications. It provides beautifully designed, accessible UI components with a comprehensive theming system based on design tokens.

## Overview

QuickCN brings the developer experience and design philosophy of shadcn/ui to the Qt ecosystem. Rather than being a traditional component library that you install as a dependency, QuickCN provides reusable QML components that integrate seamlessly with Qt Quick applications.

The library features:

- **Design System**: A complete theming system with semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, etc.) and support for different color schemes
- **OkLCH Color Space**: Advanced color definitions using the OkLCH color space for perceptually uniform colors
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are organized in separate modules that can be independently imported and used
- **CMake Integration**: Full CMake build system support for easy integration into Qt projects
